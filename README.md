# DS-Cheat-Sheet
Studying is great, but I always need to look back at notes.

This Jupyter Notebook will contain a running list of frequently used 
machine learning algorithms and Python packages. Each model will include
information on when to use it, what assumptions are required, and how to
implement the model in Python. 

I am using this process as a study tool, a future reference for myself,
and, hopefully, a helpful resource for other data scientists too.
